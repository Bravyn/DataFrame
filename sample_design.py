    "The sample for the 2022 KDHS was drawn from the Kenya Household Master Sample Frame (K-HMSF). This is the frame that KNBS currently operates to conduct household-based sample surveys in Kenya. In 2019, Kenya conducted a Population and Housing Census, and a total of 129,067 enumeration areas (EAs) were developed. Of these EAs, 10,000 were selected with probability proportional to size to create the K-HMSF.",
    
    "The 10,000 EAs were randomized into four equal subsamples. The survey sample was drawn from one of the four subsamples. The EAs were developed into clusters through a process of household listing and geo-referencing. To design the frame, each of the 47 counties in Kenya was stratified into rural and urban strata, resulting in 92 strata since Nairobi City and Mombasa counties are purely urban.",
    
    "The 2022 KDHS was designed to provide estimates at the national level, for rural and urban areas, and, for some indicators, at the county level. Given this, the sample was designed to have 42,300 households, with 25 households selected per cluster, resulting into 1,692 clusters spread across the country with 1,026 clusters in rural areas and 666 in urban areas.",
    
    "The sample for the 2022 KDHS was a stratified sample selected in two stages from the K-HMSF. In the first stage, 1,692 clusters were selected from the K-HMSF using equal probability with independent selection in each sampling stratum. Household listing was carried out in all of the selected clusters, and the resultant list of households served as a sampling frame for the second stage of selection, where 25 households were selected from each cluster. However, after the household listing procedure, it was found that some clusters had less than 25 households; hence, all of the households from these clusters were selected into the sample. This resulted in 42,022 households being sampled for the 2022 KDHS.",
    
    "All women age 15–49 who were usual members of the selected households or who had slept in the households the night before the survey were eligible for interviews. The men’s interview was conducted in half of the sampled households, and all men age 15–54 who were usual members of the selected households or who had slept in those households the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed. In a half of the men’s subsample, one man per household was randomly selected for the domestic violence module. In the other half of the men’s subsample and in the sample of households not selected for the men’s interview, one woman per household was randomly selected for the module. Thus, in three quarters of the sample, the domestic violence module was administered to women, and in one quarter of the sample the module was administered to men.",
    
    "The Biomarker Questionnaire, which included height and weight measurements, was administered in all households for children age 0–59 months and in the men’s subsample for men age 15–54 and women age 15–49. Modules on disability, COVID-19, health insurance, health expenditures, road traffic accidents, household food expenditure, early childhood development index 2030, chronic diseases, and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) were administered in half of the households sampled for the 2022 KDHS.",
    
    "The 2022 KDHS was successfully implemented in 1,691 clusters; one cluster in Mandera could not be visited due to insecurity. As a result of the nonproportional allocation to the sampling strata and due to nonresponse, the survey was not self-weighting. The resulting data have, therefore, been weighted to be representative of the various survey domains."
